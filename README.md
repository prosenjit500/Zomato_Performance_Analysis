# Zomato Performance Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Zomato's operational data, using over one 
million rows to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis is based on four core 
tables: Orders, Food, Restaurants, and Users. SQL queries were used externally for 
analysis, logic development, and validation of insights, which were then visualized using 
Power BI. The queries documented here represent the analytical foundation behind each 
dashboard visual. **.
